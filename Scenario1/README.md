Scenario 1 simulates a development of an anaerobic granule on cellobiose feed (1.5 g/L). 
Microorganims involved are:
Clostridium1 - converts cellobiose into lactate, acetate and ethanol;
Clostridium2 - converts lactate into acetate;
Desulfovibrio - converts ethanol into acetate and hydrogen;
Methanogen1 - converts acetate into methane;
Methanogen2 - converts hydrogen into methane.
