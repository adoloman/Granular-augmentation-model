Scenario 3 simulates a development of an anaerobic granule on cellobiose feed (1.5 g/L), omiting conversion of ethanol into acetate.  
Microorganims involved are:
- **Clostridium1** - converts cellobiose into lactate, acetate and ethanol;
- **Clostridium2** - converts lactate into acetate;
- **Methanogen1** - converts acetate into methane;
- **Methanogen2** - converts hydrogen into methane.

Microorganim excluded, but present in Scenario 1 and 2: **Desulfovibrio**
